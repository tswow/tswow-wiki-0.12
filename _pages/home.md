This is the archive of the 0.12 and older versions of TSWoW. Versions beyond 0.13 differ significantly in syntax and project layout. 

Documentation for versions 0.13 and beyond can be found [here](https://tswow.github.io/tswow-wiki/home/).


The aim of this wiki is to contain a beginner-friendly introduction, documentation and practical examples for how to use this tool.
Anyone is welcome to contribute, but changes won't be instant as they have to be reviewed by the TSWoW team manually.
